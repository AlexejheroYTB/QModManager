### Prefab Debugger
A prefab debugger for Subnautica that allows modders the ability to view in-game prefab hierarchies and their respective components, as well as real time editable values for each component. Still a work in progress, but it does work in game currently, and most of the features function perfectly.

**Upcoming Features**

* Finish the repopulate method so refreshing scene doesn't close all nodes
* Add noclip (different from freecam, actually moves the player)
* Add Asset browser to add prefabs/gameobject templates to scene
* Add prefab, model, texture and audio export systems 
* Provide support for modifying Texture2D, AudioSource, Mesh, Material, and GameObject properties
