# Prefab Debugger
A prefab debugger for Subnautica that allows modders the ability to view in-game prefab hierarchies and their respective components, as well as real time editable values for each component. Still a work in progress, but it does work in game currently, and most of the features function perfectly.

**Completed Features**

* ~~Reordering parents of objects~~
* ~~Adding/Removing objects and their components~~
* ~~Show selected in hierarchy~~
* ~~Add support for more components~~
* ~~Change key to be a single function key~~
* ~~Make the UI look much better (it sucks)~~
* ~~Refactor ShowSelectedComponents~~
* ~~Change component property label width to not be hardcoded~~
* ~~Add options menu to change currently hardcoded settings~~
* Raycasting objects to view their components

**Upcoming Features Post 1.4**

* Finish the repopulate method so refreshing scene doesn't close all nodes
* Add noclip (different from freecam, actually moves the player)
* Add Asset browser to add prefabs/gameobject templates to scene
* Add prefab, model, texture and audio export systems 
* Provide support for modifying Texture2D, AudioSource, Mesh, Material, and GameObject properties
