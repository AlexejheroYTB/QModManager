### Linux Instructions

Using [Steam Proton 4.2](https://www.protondb.com/app/264710), QModManager can be used with Subnautica, allowing you to use certain mods. To Get this working, the following actions should be taken.

- (Optionally) Use an application like Q4Wine to add the Steam Proton directory to your prefix list for easy access.
- Run the Windows installer in the Steam Proton directory `./steamapps/compatdata/264710/`
- Install QModManager into the actual Subnautica directory `./steamapps/common/Subnautica/`
- Manually install mods by adding them to the QMods folder in your Subnautica directory  `./steamapps/common/Subnautica/QMods/`
